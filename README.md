# Number-Game
Google CSSI Final Project

A game to teach kids how to count and write numbers! 

**Overview**

This project was created during the final week of the Google CSSI program. Using Javascript, Firebase, and neural networks, children can learn how to count and write digits easily. The web application allows users to log in and complete counting exercises. The user can draw out the digit for their guess, and the ML model recognizes the digit and the user is rewarded with points.
